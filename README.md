# Binaural Audios
Numerous studies and anecdotal evidence suggests that listening to binaural audio helps synchronize brain's different waveforms and can alter mental states. These can be used to enter and maintain states such as relaxation, focus, calm and even sleep.

## Binaural Audio Generation.
This script creates a binaural audio with user-defined frequencies and duration. The audio is saved in the same directory as the script.
Simply run `python3 binaural.py` and respond to the prompts.

## Examining and Visualizing the Audio File
To get a closer look at the audio waveforms check out the Juypter notebook `examination.ipynb` where you can graph the generated waveforms.
